Fixes and tweaks may occur over time, but there are currently no plans for any significant further development.

UNITY USAGE NOTES

In the Font Asset Creator in TextMeshPro, using a Sample Size (Point Size) of 11, padding to 1px, setting Render Mode to RASTER, and turning off "Get Font Features" will give the best results. 

Using the entire font will require a large mesh size (around 1024 x 2048), and will take hours to process on "Optimum" settings. 

After creating the Font Asset, tap the arrow on its icon to expand, go to the Atlas, and set the filter mode to "Point". This will stop any rounding and keep your font looking crisp!

This font displays properly at point sizes that are multiples of 11. Using any other point sizes isn't recommended unless you're intentionally looking for a distorted style.
